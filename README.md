# **CHP Avatar Generator**

Heya cuties! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ Do you love the six arrows of CHP as much as I do? Why not add them to your avatar? (✿◠‿◠)

With the CHP Avatar Generator, you can modify the official flag of the People's Republican Party with the colors of your own pride flag, your favorite sports club, your social media, or anything else you want! ♡( ◡‿◡ )

Plus, you can add your most kawaii animé character to your avatar in just a few milliseconds! (ﾉ´ヮ´)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

### Changes in v1.1.2

We found a small issue where the avatar image was exporting as empty, but we fixed it! (ﾉ^ヮ^)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧

## **Planned:**

We're always working on new and even cuter features for the CHP Avatar Generator! (✿◠‿◠)
